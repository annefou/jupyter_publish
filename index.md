A 1/2 day tutorial for creating publication ready scientific reports and presentations with Jupyter notebooks

Combining features of the Jupyter Notebook, WYSIWYG editors and the Latex document preparation system, to provide a workflow for:

- Dynamic editing and visualisation of key document components (text, math, figures, tables, references, citations, etc).
- Combine document elements with dynamic (and reproducible) data exploration, analysis and visualisation.
- Supply meta formatting for document and code elements for precise control over the final document layout and typesetting.
- Output the same source document to different layouts and formats (pdf, html, presentation slides, etc).
