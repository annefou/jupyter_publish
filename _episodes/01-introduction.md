# What is Jupyterlab?

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) is the next-generation web-based user 
interface for [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). It is made of modular building blocks:
- File explorer
- Text editor
- Diagram generator
- jupyter notebooks supporting more than 50 different Jupyter kernels
- Terminals
- Outputs

with an easy integration with Jupyterlab extension such as [**jupyterlab-latex**](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-latex) 
for live-editing of LaTeX documents,  [**jupyterlab-git**](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) for git integration or 
[**jupyterlab-drawio**](https://github.com/QuantStack/jupyterlab-drawio) for creating diagrams.
